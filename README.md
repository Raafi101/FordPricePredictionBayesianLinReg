# Ford Price Prediction using Bayesian Linear Regression
Used Bayesian Linear Regression to create a model that predicts Ford car prices. Utilized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to accept or reject random samples. Used Confidence intervals to show accuracy of model.

What I Learned: How to use sampling methods and efficients accept or reject samples, how to use Bayes theorem to create linear models.
